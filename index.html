            <p>
              Alishia Lockett has professionally trained a vast variety of dogs, from family pets
              to personal protection K9s. Being in Europe over the past 10 years has allowed her
              to expand her knowledge on the in-depth world of dog training and breeding. Alishia
              has owned numerous breeds, but she finds that her passion is in the working shepherds.
              Her main focus is developing puppies into strong, resilient adults able to excel in
              sport, family homes, or K9 work.
            </p>

            <p>
              She also volunteers her time and knowledge to help military families overseas become
              better handlers for their dogs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alishia trains in modern dog training and the NePoPo® system created by Bart Bellon
              and Michael Bellon. NePoPo® is a negative–positive–positive training system.
            </p>
