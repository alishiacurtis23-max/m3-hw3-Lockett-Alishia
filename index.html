         Alishia Lockett has professionally trained a vast variety of dogs, from family pets to personal protection K9s. Being in Europe over the past 10 years has allowed her to expand her knowledge on the in-depth world of dog training and breeding. Alishia has owned numerous breeds, but she finds that her passion is in the working shepherds. Her main focus is developing puppies into strong, resilient adults full of hope who are able to excel in any environment whether sport, family home or K9.

She also volunteers her time and knowledge to help military families overseas to become better handlers for their own dogs.

Alishia trains in the world of modern dog training and the NePoPo® system created by the grandfather of dog training, Bart Bellon and his wife Michael Bellon. NePoPo® is a training system where the behavior of the dog is performed  with heart and soul. NePoPo® is a negative - positive - positive training system. 

Alishia is a proud Professional member of the International Association of Canine Professionals, IACP and serves as an international Ambassador for the IACP.

She currently lives in Bayern, Germany with her husband and two kids. Together they own and operate Haus Amberg Shepherds, LLC, family owned a world-renowned breeding and training program that caters to families, K9 Units, Sport, and personal protection.
