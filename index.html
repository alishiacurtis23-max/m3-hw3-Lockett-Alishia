      <p>
        Alishia Lockett has professionally trained a vast variety of dogs, from family pets
        to personal protection K9s. Being in Europe over the past 10 years has allowed her
        to expand her knowledge on the in-depth world of dog training and breeding. Alishia
        has owned numerous breeds, but she finds that her passion is in the working shepherds.
        Her main focus is developing puppies into strong, resilient adults able to excel in
        sport, family homes, or K9 work.
      </p>

      <p>
        She also volunteers her time and knowledge to help military families overseas become
        better handlers for their dogs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alishia trains in modern dog training and the NePoPo® system created by Bart Bellon
        and Michael Bellon. NePoPo® is a negative–positive–positive training system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alishia is a proud professional member of the International Association of Canine
        Professionals (IACP) and serves as an international ambassador.
      </p>

        She currently lives in Bayern, Germany with her husband and two kids. Together they
